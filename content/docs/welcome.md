# Welcome to Product Hub

This is your personal hub for documentation and prototypes.

## Getting Started

### Adding Docs

1. Create a markdown file in the `content/docs` directory
2. Add frontmatter with title, date, and optional tags:

```yaml
---
title: My Document
date: 2024-01-01
tags: [tag1, tag2]
---
```

3. Write your content in markdown
4. The doc will automatically appear in the docs list

### Adding Prototypes

1. Create a folder in the `prototypes` directory
2. Add an `index.tsx` file with a default export React component
3. The prototype will automatically appear in the prototypes list

## Features

- **Markdown Support**: Full markdown with GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)
- **Frontmatter**: YAML frontmatter for metadata
- **Clean UI**: Minimal, focused design
- **Fast**: Built with Next.js for optimal performance

Happy documenting and prototyping!
